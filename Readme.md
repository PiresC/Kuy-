# Kuy!

An App that helps the user find their next suitable entertainment using a recommender system based on preference, budget and amount of transaction for people who want a colorful life, by input user preferences, budget and register their type of entertainment transaction.

my first doing app together with a team, and first time using Github as a collaboration tool. this is mini-challenge 1 for Apple Academy. some of the features in this app are
* onboarding = let the user choose their preferences for kind of entertainment users like
* dashboard = dashboard full of features and segment, on the navigation, there is a setting to let user reset the budget and there is a button to add a new expense. 
* recommendation = the first segment on the dashboard, let the user choose from the variety of entertainment that tailor for the user, based on user preferences, budget, and how often the transaction happen.
* Budget = budget is a second segment which shows the user how much budget left, and user spending allocation, in the beautiful donut chart, and color-coded. there is a budget detail to edit the budget and show detail of the latest transaction from the variety of entertainment, sort based percentage of the spending.
* Expense = the app will let user record spending, for recommendation and budget detail.
* News = news for entertainment-related event
